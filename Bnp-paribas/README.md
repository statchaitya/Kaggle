## Kaggle Competition - BNP Paribas Cardiff Claims Management
## Year - 2016
## Final Rank: 225/2926 (Top 8%)

**Description**

In a world shaped by the emergence of new uses and lifestyles, everything is going faster and faster. When facing unexpected events, customers expect their insurer to support them as soon as possible. However, claims management may require different levels of check before a claim can be approved and a payment can be made. With the new practices and behaviors generated by the digital economy, this process needs adaptation thanks to data science to meet the new needs and expectations of customers.

In this challenge, BNP Paribas Cardif is providing an anonymized database with two categories of claims:

1. claims for which approval could be accelerated leading to faster payments
2. claims for which additional information is required before approval

Kagglers are challenged to predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers.
